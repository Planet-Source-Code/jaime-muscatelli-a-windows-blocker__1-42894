### Description

This is a simple windows blocker I made for my mother in an hour. It is a full-screen window that (at startup) hides the desktop, hides the toolbar, and closes any window that opens while the program is open! It even blocks the start menu! A simple password dialog. Enter the correct password and it shows everything again and closes itself. Also LOGS the confirmation (or lack thereof) into a dll. You can then view the log and see what time someone entered (or tried to) your computer. Try it out. Uses API as well! KEYWORDS: Windows Blocker Hide Start StartBar Menu Password Dialog Full Screen Access DLL Log Entry
